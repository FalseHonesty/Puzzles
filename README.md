# JVM Puzzles

A collection of some fun puzzles I've created to challenge people's knowledge of the JVM.
Solutions are provided to each of these puzzles, but if you've come up with your own unique solution,
please make a PR, I'd love to include it. If you have any good topics for a puzzle, feel free to
create an issue with your suggested topics, and I'll look into making a fun challenge based
around it! If you've already created your own puzzle, I may also include it here too :)

## Layout

Each folder contains a separate puzzle. The top level of that folder should contain the puzzle files,
such as the main Java puzzle template files, as well as any additional required resources. In each
folder will also be a "Solutions" folder containing at least one provided solution to the puzzle.
